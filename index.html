        Four iPhones, four different sizes

        The iPhone 16 series comes in four sizes. The iPhone 16 is the smallest of the lot, featuring a 6.1-inch screen. Then comes the iPhone 16 Pro featuring a 6.3-inch screen. The iPhone 16 Plus has a 6.7-inch screen, and lastly, the iPhone 16 Pro Max with a massive 6.9-inch screen, the biggest iPhone ever.


        Screen size isn't the only display-related difference on the iPhone 16 series. Just like the previous generation models, Apple has limited 120Hz high-refresh-rate panels to the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max, while the regular iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus come with a 60Hz screen, which is the same as the original iPhone, launched in 2007.

        The bezels around the iPhone 16 Pro series are also much thinner, offering a more premium look and feel. While all four models still include a dynamic island, from a distance, they look almost identical from the front. Thanks to the faster refresh rate, the iPhone 16 Pro series will feel a tad smoother, and some games can also benefit from the higher refresh rate panels.
